I created this Dark series report using Power BI for learning purposes and out of my interest in the show. The report includes information on all three seasons, such as episode names, runtimes, IMDb ratings, and character descriptions. It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to develop my skills in data visualization and analysis. I hope you enjoy exploring the report as much as I enjoyed creating it!
